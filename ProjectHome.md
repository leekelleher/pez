Pez (Personal Zeitgeist) provides a simple homepage profile for people who use many external websites and want to aggregate them all in one place.

Essentially it is a personal RSS aggregator, utilizing microformats to mark-up your profile data.

The concept was originally based on the [Personal Zeitgeist](http://www.creativesynthesis.net/blog/projects/personal-zeitgeist/) software by [Creative Synthesis](http://www.creativesynthesis.net/)
